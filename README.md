# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Purpose: The purpose of this project is to go through extracting, transforming and loading backer's contact information, hence'backer_info' that includes data listed in rows, which I'd have to split into columns, creating an ERD, creating a schema with ALTER statments to create and import tables necessary for visualization and analysis.

Initially, my data wasn't importing into SQL, so in order to rerun the backers table I had to rename "backers" to "backers2" and "pk_backers" to "pk_backers2" 

However, below is my final result, and I was able to import the backers.csv file without any errors, and I was able to display the table which did match the csv file.
